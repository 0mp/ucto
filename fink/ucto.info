DescDetail: <<
Ucto can tokenize UTF-8 encoded text files (i.e. separate words from
punctuation, split sentences, generate n-grams), and  offers several other
basic preprocessing steps (change case, count words/characters and reverse
lines) that make your text suited for further processing such as indexing,
part-of-speech tagging, or machine translation.

Ucto is a product of the ILK Research Group, Tilburg University (The
Netherlands).

If you are interested in machine parsing of UTF-8 encoded text files, e.g. to
do scientific research in natural language processing, ucto will likely be of
use to you.
